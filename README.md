# grad-project
This repository contains the code for my graduation project, which builds a system to separate mixed modulation signals and classify them.

I mainly have 2 plans. First, treat this problem as a multi-label classification problem and try to build an end-to-end model directly. Second, if the first plan didn't work, I will try to separate the radio signal first and classify the signal one by one. Consider the maturity of single signal classification, the only thing we should worry about is to separate those signal correctly.
